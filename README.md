# Zoomable

This project is the parent of the `ngx-xoomable` library and was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng build ngx-zoomable --configuration production --watch` to build the included library (and watch for changes).

Then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200). The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files (or the library itself).
